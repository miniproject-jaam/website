<h2>TERMS AND PRIVACY</h2>
<p><b>Because a Terms and Conditions agreement is the agreement<br>
 where you inform the users of your website about the rules,<br>
 terms and guidelines that they need to follow in order to<br>
 use and access your website,<br> a Terms and Conditions <br>
 agreement has become extremely important.<br>

   While it's not required by any laws currently<br> 
(but third-parties such as Facebook may require it),<br>
through a Terms and Conditions you can maintain your<br> 
rights to exclude certain users that<br> may abuse<br>
 your website or do not follow the rules you set.<br>

It doesn't really matter what kind of platform your website uses:<br>

*WordPress<br>
*Joomla, Drupal<br>
*Wix<br>
*Weebly<br>
And so on<br>
If you don't have this agreement for your website yet, use the Generator to create it!</b>
